Array Exercises for AIE.

Download the program by clicking [here,](https://github.com/charlie-flynn/ArrayExercises/releases) then clicking on the ArrayExercises_V1.0.zip file at the top of the Assets list to download it!

Now that the file is downloaded, go into your Downloads folder to find ArrayExercises_V1.0.zip. Right-click the file, then click "Extract All".

Afterwards, open the newly extracted folder, and double-click the file named ArrayExercises.exe to run the program!

I do highly recommend clicking on the file named README.txt, located in the same folder. It contains some useful information about the program that is a little more in-depth than this file!

To input the length of the array and the integers in it, type in the number you wish to enter, then press the ENTER key.

This program takes an array of any length up to 50 and does the following:
- Prints the array in the order it was inputted
- Prints the array in the opposite order it was inputted
- Prints the sum of all of the integers in the array
- Prints the highest integer in the array
- Prints the lowest integer in the array
- Prints the array sorted by the lowest integer to the highest (bonus feature!)
