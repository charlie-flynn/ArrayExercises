Array Exercises for AIE.

Download the program [here!](https://github.com/charlie-flynn/ArrayExercises/releases)

Then right-click the .ZIP, and click Extract All.

Afterwards, you're good to run the executable (.exe) file that's in the folder!

To input the length of the array and the integers in it, type in the number you wish to enter, then press the ENTER key.

This program takes an array of any length up to 50 and does the following:
- Prints the array in the order it was inputted
- Prints the array in the opposite order it was inputted
- Prints the sum of all of the integers in the array
- Prints the highest integer in the array
- Prints the lowest integer in the array
- Prints the array sorted by the lowest integer to the highest (bonus feature!)
